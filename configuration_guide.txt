This guide helps you set up the necessary environment and credentials for running the Reddit scraper tool.

1. **Setting up Reddit API credentials**:
   - Visit https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

   - Fill in the details:
     - `name`: Name of your app/tool (e.g., "RedditScraper")
     - `App type`: Script
     - `description`: You can leave this blank.
     - `permissions`: Read
     - `redirect uri`: http://localhost:8080
     - Other fields as necessary.
   - Click "Create app".
   - Once created, you will see your `CLIENT_ID` (right under the app name) and `CLIENT_SECRET` (inside the app details). Make note of these.

2. **Configuring the reddit_scraper.py**:

   - Fill in the `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `USER_AGENT` fields with your Reddit API credentials.
     - `USER_AGENT`: A unique description of your script. For instance, "reddit_scraper_v1.0"

   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
